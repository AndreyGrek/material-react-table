### License

Material React Table is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/KevinVandy/material-react-table/blob/main/LICENSE) and is free to use in both personal and commercial projects.

### Motivation

[`material-react-table`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-react-table) started out as an attempt to upgrade the once popular [material-table](https://material-table.com/) library to Material UI v5 and TypeScript, since that project seemed to have become abandoned. However, after a few frustrating weeks, it was discovered that it would be easier and more fun to write a new advanced Material UI table library from scratch. [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) naturally seemed like a great basis for the underlying API and therefore was chosen as the foundation for the project.

        acceptedAnswer: {
          '@type': 'Answer',
          text: '<p>It depends. If you are already using <b>MUI</b> for other components in your project, and are looking for a efficient and fully featured data grid component to drop in, this may be the perfect library for you. MRT is not necessarily the lightest weight table library out there, but it has a much <b>smaller bundle size</b> than similar libraries like material-table. If you are looking for the most powerful data grid possible, <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/" target="_blank"><b>AG Grid</b></a> is still recommended above MRT as long as you do not care about bundle size.</p>',
