### Pre 1.0 breaking changes

- v1.0.0-beta.16 - `selectAllMode` default value changed to `"page"`

- v0.41.0 - Filter start icon will no longer be shown if `enableColumnFilterModes` is not enabled
- v0.40.7 - `enabledGlobalFilterOptions` renamed to `globalFilterModeOptions`
- v0.40.2 - new `tableInstanceRef` and `virtualizerInstanceRef` props

- v0.37.2 - Aggregation cell renders enabled, `AggregatedCell` needed to render aggregated cell.
- v0.37.0 - Major Editing Feature Changes: `"modal"` is now the default `editingMode`. New required `exitEditingMode` param in `onEditingRowSave` to allow dev to exit editing mode only after validation passes. Fix auto-filled values not saving in editing row submit. `tableId` prop removed as it is now unnecessary and was being confused with an html id attribute. Major internal ref refactors to better follow React best practices and improve performance.
- v0.36.0 - `onCellEditBlur` and `onCellEditChange` props removed because the already exist on `muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps`. Examples given [here](/docs/guides/editing)
- v0.35.2 - Change `onEditRowSubmit` name to `onEditingRowSave`
- v0.35.1 - "current" prefix in some state options removed from name (i.e. `currentEditingRow` is now just `editingRow`), new editing value(s) arguments, better types for editing features
- v0.34.0 - rolled back to react-virtual 2.0 to fix flickering issue, MRT_Internal Toolbar components are now exported from MRT instead of in params
- v0.33.0 - `onTableInstanceChange` removed, `onStateChange` removed, `currentFilterFns` renamed to `columnFilterFns`, custom `filterFns` can be used again, renamed `ToolbarBottom` to `BottomToolbar` and `ToolbarTop` to `TopToolbar`
- v0.31.0 - new DropZone component in toolbar for grouping while dragging a column that can be grouped
- v0.29.0 - new `filterVariant` option on columnDef to indicate if filter is a select filter, multi-select filter, text filter, etc.
- v0.28.0 - `virtualizerProps` has slightly differently named options, as MRT upgraded to `@tanstack/react-virtual` `v3`.
- v0.27.0 - `enableColumnFilterModes` is now false by default, but can be turned on easily by just setting it to true.
- v0.23.0 - TanStack Table v8.2 has new `cell.getValue<>()` generics
- v0.22.1 - `showFilters` state renamed to `showColumnFilters`
- v0.22.0 - React DnD replaced with custom solution for drag and drop. Now lib is 16kb smaller!
- V0.19.0 - Data Column Definitions now need an `accessorKey` or a combination of an `id` and `accessorFn` to be used as the key for the data row.
- V0.19.0 - `instance` was renamed to `table` across all callback functions to be inline with TanStack Table V8.1.
- V0.18.0 - on...Changed callback props were removed as they were redundant with the on...Change callback props. Hoisting state will be the recommended way to watch for table state changes and react to them.

## Roadmap

### V1 (2022)

The main focus for additional releases for V1 will be adding more locales and improving the documentation.

### V2

No work has started on V2 yet, but the main focus will be to take advantage of React 18 concurrent mode features to improve performance.
